<h1>Web Technology Basics</h1>
<p>
    The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol
    suite (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices. It is a network of networks that
    comprises private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope,
    linked by electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast
    range of information services and resources, such as the interlinked hypertext documents and
    applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, discussion groups, internet telephony,
    streaming media and file sharing.

    Most traditional communication media, including telephone, radio, television, paper mail, newspapers,
    and print publishing, have been transformed by the Internet, giving rise to new media such as email,
    online music, digital newspapers, news aggregators, and audio and video streaming websites. The
    Internet has enabled and accelerated new forms of personal interaction through instant messaging,
    Internet forums, and social networking services. Online shopping has also grown to occupy a
    significant market across industries, enabling firms to extend brick and mortar presences to serve
    larger markets. Business-to-business and financial services on the Internet affect supply chains
    across entire industries.
