    CSS plays a vital role in web design because it controls the visual presentation and layout of a website, separating content from design. By using
    CSS, developers can ensure consistency across multiple web pages, making sites look professional and well-organized. It allows precise control
    over colors, fonts, spacing, alignment, and responsiveness, which improves user experience and readability. CSS also reduces code duplication,
    making websites faster to load and easier to maintain. With advanced features like animations, transitions, and responsive layouts, CSS helps
    create visually appealing, interactive, and device-friendly websites that meet modern web standards.
