/*  Q12. Write a java program in which main thread should create two child threads (Producer and Consumer). First child thread (Producer) should
        produce ten random integers between 1 to 100 and the second child thread (Consumer) should check whether the generated number is even or odd.
        At the end the second child thread (Consumer) should print total number of even numbers received. Both the threads should wait and notify each
        other wherever necessary.
