/*  Q11. Write a Java thread program to search the minimum number in a given array. The program should read the number of elements in the array,
         number of threads to be created and the array elements from the user. Each thread should find minimum element in an assigned block of
         elements and compare to global minimum element. When all the threads are done, the global variable should contain the minimum element. It
         should use a Synchronized block to make sure that only one thread is updating the global minimum variable at any given time.
