/*  Q10. Write a simple Java thread program to compute the sum of n natural numbers. The program should read the number of threads m and value of n
         from the user. Each of the threads should add its share of assigned number to a global variable. When all the threads are done, the global
         variable should contain the result. The program should use a Synchronized block to make sure that only one thread is updating the global
         variable at a given time.
